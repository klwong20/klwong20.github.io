        <h1>Photo Galleries</h1>
        <p>Ever since getting my first phone (an iPhone 5S) back in 2013, I've developed a passion for photography and videography.  Literally capturing moments is the easiest way for me to remember events, from trans-oceanic flights to something interesting that happened in school.</p>
        <p>I've taken pictures of several physical locations, some of which you might find on Google Maps.  However, it wasn't until I started my website in July 2021 that I was able to share pictures of buses and planes to the public.</p>

        <h2>Current Equipment</h2>
        <p>My primary camera for still photography is the Canon G9 X Mark II, which I acquired in August 2020.  I also used this camera for filming some videos before making the conversion to 4K video for my YouTube channel.  The Canon G9 X Mark II is a pocket sized point-and-shoot camera with a 1-inch sensor, allowing it to take very good photos.</p>
        <p>My primary video camera is the Sony FDR-AX43.  I acquired this camcorder in March 2021 after being appointed as UCI Circle K's videographer, but I also use this for my own YouTube channel (it was purchased with my own money).  A more affordable variant of the Sony FDR-AX53, it's able to shoot 4K video at 30 frames per second.</p>
        <p>My secondary "camera" is the iPhone 11, which I acquired in January 2020.  It takes good pictures (for a smartphone) and is able to record 4K video at 60 frames per second (albeit not as good as the AX43).</p>
