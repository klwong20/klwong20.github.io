        <p>This page is home to some personal projects and other page ideas I have.</p>
        <h2>Change Thru Games Website (Circle K International at UC Irvine)</h2>
        <img src="CTG9.png" class="img-fluid" width="500px" alt="">
        <p>Change Thru Games (CTG) is an annual gaming charity fundraiser hosted by UC Irvine Circle K.  The 9th edition of CTG occurred on November 19, 2022, with proceeds benefiting the Prevent Cancer Foundation.</p>
        <p>I served as the marketing chair for this edition of CTG.  Since I had experience designing my personal website, Andy Chen, the CTG chair, asked if I was able to design the CTG website, and I accepted.</p>
        <p>The previous CTG website was based on PHP and not fully adaptive and responsive, meaning that some aspects of it were not designed with mobile devices in mind.  In addition, the main UCI Circle K website was converted from PHP to Angular, meaning it would be extremely difficult to integrate the existing CTG site to the main website.</p>
        <p>In order to make the website adaptive and responsive while also adapting to the main website's new framework, I started over almost completely from scratch using Bootstrap, using the general layout of the old website as a starting point.  The result is an eye-popping website that both effectively advertises the event and works on mobile devices.</p>

        <h2>ZotGuessr</h2>
        <img src="Zotguessr.svg" class="img-fluid" width="400px" alt="">
        <p>ZotGuessr: it's like GeoGuessr, but with locations at and around the UCI campus and fun facts.  UCI and its surrounding area is really nice, but some locations might be a bit hard to locate (even with UCI's circular design).  ZotGuessr allows users to guess the location of a campus landmark based on Google Street View.</p>
        <p>ZotGuessr won the "Most Polished Game" and 2nd place "Best Use of Google Cloud" awards at HackUCI 2022.  I worked on this project along with Advay Anand, Douglas Hong, Eric Huang, and Davin Singh as part of HackUCI 2022.  I did some consulting on the user interface and worked on the project's Devpost page.</p>

        <h2>Anteater Express</h2>
        <img src="other/lot36.JPG" class="img-fluid" width="500px" alt="A view of Anteater Express buses at Lot 36.">
        <p>In my personal opinion, the official schedules Anteater Express provides are awful and are not very useful due to their lack of specific departure times.  During my time at Anteater Express, I've designed my own schedule documents, which includes every trip and departure times from each timed stop for each route.  Just for fun, I've also created a page where I talk about specific buses in the Anteater Express fleet.</p>
