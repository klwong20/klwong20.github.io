        <h1>Anteater Express Buses & Routes: Ranked</h1>
        <p>While the vast majority of the Anteater Express consists of BYD K9M 40 foot battery electric buses, they're not created equal.  Some of them are a pleasure to drive on.  Others... not so much.  Here's my commentary of each of AntEx's buses (and routes because why not).  This page will be updated for as long as I'm an AntEx bus operator.</p>
        <h2>Buses Ranked</h2>
        <h3>AE-01</h3>
        <img src="../buses/antex/k9m-002.jpeg" class="img-fluid" width="500px">
        <p>Ahh, the number one.  This is a pleasant bus to drive on, but the front door could use some WD-40 or something, that thing squeaks like crazy.</p>
        <h3>AE-02</h3>
        <img src="../buses/antex/k9m-017.jpeg" class="img-fluid" width="500px">
        <p>Fun fact, they took marketing pictures of this bus at what I presume to be Lancaster (which is where BYD USA's buses are built).  Again, it's a nice bus.</p>
        <h3>AE-03</h3>
        <img src="../buses/antex/k9m-016.jpeg" class="img-fluid" width="500px">
        <p>Eh, I've seen better.</p>
        <h3>AE-04</h3>
        <img src="../buses/antex/k9m-038.jpeg" class="img-fluid" width="500px">
        <p>The brakes are kinda crappy on this one and the gooseneck doesn't work, but the radio is quite nice on this one.</p>
        <h3>AE-05</h3>
        <img src="../buses/antex/k9m-028.jpeg" class="img-fluid" width="500px">
        <p>Okay, here's where things get interesting.  While it's a good bus to drive on, it apparently has a smoking tire issue.  In fact, one of my first shifts with passengers involved me driving this bus back to the lot and swapping it.  This bus also has broken tail lights whenever the accelerator is pushed, which confused dispatch for a bit during my shift.</p>
        <h3>AE-06</h3>
        <img src="../buses/antex/antex-k9m-m-001.JPG" class="img-fluid" width="500px">
        <p>No comment, but it does make a nice desktop background.</p>
        <h3>AE-07</h3>
        <img src="../buses/antex/antex-k9m-a-001.JPG" class="img-fluid" width="500px">
        <p>Oof.  If you ask any AntEx operator what their least favorite bus is, it'll probably be either this bus or AE-13.  Why?  Here's a little lesson...</p>
        <p>The BYD K9M is equipped with regenerative brakes.  Once the bus reaches about a 95% state of charge (SOC), the regen brakes activate.  This means that, as you release your foot from the accelerator, the bus will start to brake on its own.  Of course, the regular service brake pedal can still be used.</p>
        <p>Many buses in the AntEx fleet have very sensitive brakes.  On a flat surface, if I engage the service brake a bit too much, I feel a "jolting" sensation.  Think of it as fully engaging on the brake pedal on a vehicle without regen brakes, except on the bus I'm barely pushing on it.  It's especially bad in the back, where the seats are not nearly as comfortable and many passengers are standing.</p>
        <p>We're taught in training to rely mostly on the regen brake, only engaging on the service brake at the last moment.  I try to do this to the best of my ability, but sometimes I misgauge things (I'm a human, not a robot) and use the service brake a bit too much.  If you're a passenger reading this, just know that we try to provide a comfortable ride to the best of our ability.</p>
        <p>If it wasn't clear earlier, I don't like this bus.</p>
        <h3>AE-08</h3>
        <img src="../buses/antex/k9m-012.jpeg" class="img-fluid" width="500px">
        <p>I very rarely drive this bus.  It drives decently, but one of the stop request buttons is jammed, making it kinda hard to tell whether a stop is actually requested or not.</p>
        <h3>AE-09</h3>
        <img src="../buses/antex/k9m-018.jpeg" class="img-fluid" width="500px">
        <p>Again, no comment.</p>
        <h3>AE-10</h3>
        <img src="../buses/antex/antex-k9m-h-001.JPG" class="img-fluid" width="500px">
        <p>This is another bus with crappy brakes.  But wait, there's more!  Story time...</p>
        <p>One time, the front door started closing on its own, and the regular door handle wouldn't open it either.  Dispatch told me to take the bus out of service if I was comfortable doing so.  I closed the front door manually, but the bus wouldn't move.  Dispatch told me to do something I will not explain on a public website.  The bus still wouldn't move, but then I tried the door handle again.  Apparently the door interlock is only disengaged when the front door is closed using the door handle.</p>
        <p>The drive back was quite interesting.  Have you ever driven with no lights before?  In the dark?  And I'm not even talking the headlights, I'm talking all lights, not even the turn signals worked.  Was this a case of user error?  Possibly.  But hey, I still got back to the lot safely.</p>
        <h3>AE-11</h3>
        <img src="../buses/antex/k9m-025.jpeg" class="img-fluid" width="500px">
        <p>I forgot if it was this bus or 13, but I took my second DMV test on one of these buses (in case you're wondering, I failed the first time for cutting someone off in Costa Mesa, oops).  Luckily, I passed the second time, but as my examiner was going over my driving, I distinctly remember this part:</p>
        <p>Supervisor: "Your braking should be smoother."</p>
        <p>Me: "This must be one of the buses with the crappy brakes."</p>
        <p>Supervisor: "Yeah, but the passengers aren't gonna know that."</p>
        <p>It's true, passengers don't know a lot of things.  I've seen worse brakes on other buses, but the ones on 11 aren't perfect.</p>
        <h3>AE-12</h3>
        <img src="../buses/antex/k9m-005.jpeg" class="img-fluid" width="500px">
        <p>No comment.</p>
        <h3>AE-13</h3>
        <img src="../buses/antex/k9m-010.jpeg" class="img-fluid" width="500px">
        <p>In many cultures, 13 is seen as an unlucky number.  AE-13's brakes are pretty horrendous, living up to its infamous number.</p>
        <h3>AE-14</h3>
        <img src="../buses/antex/ae14-oos-001.JPG" class="img-fluid" width="500px">
        <p>No comment.  However, last time I saw it, it was parked at the very edge of Lot 36 with the "Needs Repair" sign, so there must be some kind of issue with it.</p>
        <h3>AE-15</h3>
        <img src="../buses/antex/k9m-004.jpeg" class="img-fluid" width="500px">
        <p>Although the brakes on this bus aren't perfect, they aren't bad.  What really makes this bus stand out, however, is the vibrating noise it makes when going at high speeds (like below 50).  I remember driving this bus on A Line going northbound on Culver when I noticed the vibrations for the first time.  I asked my passengers if they've heard anything, the said no.  I called dispatch, they say they'll let me know if they want to swap the bus.</p>
        <p>During my second round of the day, I call back dispatch explaining the exact location of the sound.  They reply saying that it's a known issue and they haven't been able to identify why the bus vibrates.  I mean, if it works, it works.</p>
        <h3>AE-16</h3>
        <img src="../buses/antex/k9m-021.jpeg" class="img-fluid" width="500px">
        <p>The regen brakes on this bus are very strong, but in return, the service brakes are buttery smooth.  This is a very nice bus.</p>
        <h3>AE-17</h3>
        <img src="../buses/antex/k9m-007.jpeg" class="img-fluid" width="500px">
        <p>Another bus with smooth brakes.</p>
        <h3>AE-18</h3>
        <img src="../buses/antex/k9m-013.jpeg" class="img-fluid" width="500px">
        <p>Driving wise, it's a decent bus, but there are a few quirks.  This bus beeps every time I disengage the parking brake.  Some buses will make a very loud buzzing sound when you disengage the parking brake on neutral, but in this case, a brief "beep" is made every single time, even while on drive.  Also, last time I drove this bus, the cap for the four way flasher switch was missing, so it blended in with the rest of my switches.  Mildly annoying.</p>
        <h3>AE-19</h3>
        <img src="../buses/antex/k9m-011.jpeg" class="img-fluid" width="500px">
        <p>I don't think I've ever seen 19 in service until November of 2021.  Never during the 2020-2021 school year, never during training.  Not only are the brakes on this bus horrendous, but the radio straight up doesn't work.  A lot of buses have radios with shoddy reception, but on 19, it's literal white noise 24/7.</p>
        <h3>AE-20</h3>
        <img src="../buses/antex/antex-k9m-n-001.JPG" class="img-fluid" width="500px">
        <p>20, eww.  One, the brakes are horrendous, but you probably guessed that already.  I remember driving this bus a lot during training, and there were ants all over the drivers cab area.  It wasn't a full on infestation, but it was still off putting.  Oh, and the PA, can I talk about the PA for a bit?</p>
        <p>Most drivers never use the PA ever.  I use it religiously because I want my passengers to be informed and because I've seen some very valuable items lost and then left unclaimed during my shifts.  On some buses, the gooseneck microphone won't work but the handheld microphone will.  On this bus, both technically work.  However, whenever I do use it, there's a very good chance there will be a very loud screeching noise that won't shut up until I mess with some switches.</p>
        <p>Previously, this bus would also have a certain message pop up on the dash from time to time that sounds scary, but the bus continues to function as normal.  It's been out of service for some time after they already tried to "fix" the issue once, so I'm assuming this issue is not present anymore.</p>
        <p>The cherry on top is the destination sign.  It's very glitched.</p>
        <h3>FC-1</h3>
        <p>FC-1 is the oddball out of the AntEx fleet, as this is an ElDorado National hydrogen fuel cell bus.  Apparently, it's been broken for several years, but from what I've heard, it's not a pleasant bus to drive and hydrogen is a very expensive fuel.</p>
        <h2>Routes Ranked</h2>
        <img src="antexsign.JPG" class="img-fluid" width="500px">
        <h3>C Line</h3>
        <p>C Line has got to be the hidden gem of the AntEx route network.  It's designed to serve Arroyo Vista and Camino del Sol.  Because passengers aren't familiar with how our schedules work, many opt to take N Line instead, making C Line relatively empty.  It's quiet, but rounds are 20 minutes, so at least it's quick.  I love C Line as a passenger, not so much as a driver.</p>
        <h3>V Line</h3>
        <p>I haven't driven V line often and I'm never a passenger on it, but it's a pretty cool route, especially since it goes both northbound and southbound on Culver.  The "lollipop" and the end of Arroyo Dr is fun too.  It's never too crowded from my experience.</p>
        <h3>A Line</h3>
        <p>A Line is a combination of the C and V Lines for mid-day and evening service.  During mid-day, A Line gets decently packed, mostly because it only runs on a 30 minute frequency.  After 4, things start to quiet down with the addition of a second bus.  It's rare that I make it to my timed stops on-time, but that's okay because rounds are 30 minutes, so there's usually time to catch up.</p>
        <h3>N Line</h3>
        <p>This is my personal favorite line as a driver, it's so fun.  Full buses are quite common; I have "my bus is now full, requesting permission to leave early" and the ODK codes engraved in my brain now.  I use the PA a lot whenever I'm at admin, telling passengers "once all seats are filled, you may take any available standing room including in the back".  Of course, a lot of passengers don't actually listen, as they'll just stay in the middle of the bus right next to the back door when there's plenty of space in the back ("oh, i need to get to my place like ten seconds faster").  The 30 minute rounds during mid-day and evening service are quite generous, leaving me plenty of time to take a bathroom break if needed.</p>
        <h3>P Line</h3>
        <p>"Does this bus go to the ARC?"  Yes it does.  P Line is weird, introduced during the 2021-2022 school year to serve Plaza Verde residents heading to campus.  Often times, though, there will already be an N Line bus pulled up at the Plaza Verde stop, leaving my bus completely empty, and I mean completely empty.  On top of that, there's some passengers who specifically want to take the N Line bus because it gets to admin a few seconds faster (I mean, that's on you if you choose to enter a sardine can).  The rounds are only 20 minutes long, but I ound the timed stop at the ARC to be too long (luckily they shortened it for winter quarter service).</p>
        <h3>M Line</h3>
        <p>M Line has so much potential; it has a very fun and unique route, serving the campus core instead of the ACC apartments.  Unfortunately, due to the current nationwide bus driver shorgate, it's almost useless nowadays.  M Line currently only operates after 4 PM at a 30 minute frequency, and the 30 minute rounds are far too long.  There's the usual wait at admin, but on top of that, there's so many timed stops.  It's not like the timed stops on A Line where I rarely get there on-time; they're the timed stops where I wait for several minutes with nothing to do.  Driving M Line is very boring, almost like a chore.</p>
