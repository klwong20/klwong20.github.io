        <p>Hi there!</p>
        <p>My name is Kevin Wong, and I'm a second-year computer science major at the University of California, Irvine.  I come from Honolulu, HI, lived in fabulous Las Vegas, NV for most of my life, and I currently live at the beautiful UC Irvine campus.</p>
        <p>Anything transportation related excites me.  It could be airlines and airplanes, connecting the world via the miracle of flight (and potentially being pampered in the process).  It could be the mass transit systems found all over the world, connecting locals through buses, subways, trains, and more in a highly efficient manner.  It could even be highways, allowing people and freight to be transported all over flexibly.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I like taking pictures wherever I go, edit videos, and work on other projects, such as the website you're on.  Occasionally, I'll edit the maps on Waze, ensuring that those who use the app get up-to-date routing information.  I also play a few video games, namely Cities: Skylines and American Truck Simulator.  If I'm in the mood for multiplayer, catch me playing Team Fortress 2 or Rocket League.</p>

        <h2>My Current Positions</h2>
        <h3>Circle K International</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Media Chair (Videographer) at UCI Circle K (March 2021-Present)</li>
            <li>Technology Internship Program Member at UCI Circle K (Ongoing)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Circle K International is the collegiate branch of Kiwanis, a community service organization.  With almost 400 members (pre-Covid), the UC Irvine chapter of Circle K is the largest in the world.  Circle K provides community service opportunities to members, as well as socials and professional development events.</p>
        <p>As videographer for UCI Circle K, I'm responsible for filming and editing video content for the club while assisting my two other media chairs if necessary.  My biggest projects was the 11 Meet the Bigs videos.  I'm also responsible with communicating with the rest of the executive and appointed board, as well as our membership.</p>
        <p>The Technology Internship Program at UCI Circle K is a committee formed during an academic quarter when needed by the technology chairs.  Over the summer, TIP members assist the technology chairs in revamping the UCI Circle K website to fit the new club theme.  During other quarters, TIP members assist the technology chairs in minor issues with the website, as well as any other projects.</p>
        <h3>Anteater Express</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bus Operator (September 2021-Present)</li>
            <li>Trainee (May 2021-September 2021)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Anteater Express, operated by ASUCI, provides transit services to the UC Irvine community.  Shuttle routes connect the UCI campus with East Campus housing communities, various off-campus housing communities, and retail complexes like Irvine Spectrum Center and The District at Tustin Legacy.</p>
        <p>As a bus operator, I hold a Class B commercial driver's license with a passenger endorsement.  The safe operation of Anteater Express' 40-foot battery electric buses is my number 1 priority, from performing inspections to making safe driving decisions.  I also provide excellent service to my passengers while maintaining a schedule, getting UCI affiliates to wherever they need to be.</p>
